/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CannaConnect application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for most data, with shared access for private messaging.
 * All user-generated content (posts, comments, cultivation tasks, plant analyses) is stored under
 * user-specific collections to ensure clear ownership and simplify security rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/posts/{postId}: Stores posts created by a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments associated with a specific post.
 * - /users/{userId}/cultivationTasks/{taskId}: Stores cultivation tasks created by a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/plantAnalyses/{analysisId}: Stores plant analysis records created by a specific user.
 * - /messages/{messageId}: Stores chat messages between users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read/write their own profile data and their associated content (posts, tasks, analyses).
 * - Users can only access chat messages where they are the sender or recipient.
 * - Listing of all users is disallowed for privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Each document in user-owned subcollections (posts, tasks, analyses) implicitly has the `userId`
 *   as the owner, avoiding the need for separate `get()` calls to verify ownership.
